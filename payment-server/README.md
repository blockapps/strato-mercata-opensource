## Dependencies

1. Docker Engine v24+ (For dockerized deployment)
2. Docker Compose V2
3. NodeJS 14+

*NOTE*  
Report and update dependencies if needed.

## Running

The server **requires** the following environmental variables to run in non-dockerized mode:
```
`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` for Stripe API
`STRIPE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` to the Stripe ExternalPaymentService contract
`METAMASK_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` to the MetaMask ExternalPaymentService contract

-- Optional --
`POSTGRES_SERVER_URL`
`POSTGRES_PORT`
`POSTGRES_USER`
`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
`POSTGRES_DBNAME`

```

If running non-dockerized, use `npm run start` or `npm run dev`.  
If running dockerized, provide a `docker-compose.payment-server.yml` file and use `docker-compose -f docker-compose.payment-server.yml up -d --remove-orphans`.

## Script
To manually run the script below, first copy the necessary config files by running:
```
cp /config/config.yaml config.yaml
cp /config/deploy.yaml config/deploy.yaml
```

To offboard a seller, run the following command:
```
SELLER_NAME="sellerCommonName" yarn offboard
```

## Testing

The payment server uses `jest` as its testing framework. In order to run the tests, the following environment variables should be available:
```
<!-- REQUIRED ENV -->
`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` for Stripe API
`STRIPE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` to the Stripe ExternalPaymentService contract
`METAMASK_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` to the MetaMask ExternalPaymentService contract
`TEST_MODE` = 'true'

-- Optional --
`POSTGRES_SERVER_URL`
`POSTGRES_PORT`
`POSTGRES_USER`
`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
`POSTGRES_DBNAME`
```

**It is highly recommended to use a separate database for testing purposes**. Afterwards, simply run `npm run test`.
