# Contributing to STRATO Mercata platform (open source snapshot)

This repository is a stripped down initial snapshot of the STRATO Mercata platform, tools and applications.

It should be possible to build all of the applications, but tests and build automation and various legacy
parts of the code have been removed in a pretty crude way, just to give us a starting point.

It is likely that running nearly any of this code will still have dependencies onto infrastructure, accounts
and credentials which only BlockApps Inc have access to.  We will work through these roadblocks as we move
forward with the open sourcing effort.

In the meantime, we would love to hear from anybody who is looking at this code and will help in whatever
way we can.

Please do log Github issues at https://github.com/blockapps/strato-mercata-opensource/issues or create
pull requests at https://github.com/blockapps/strato-mercata-opensource/pulls.

There is also an Open Source channel on Telegram: https://t.me/mercatamarket.

We need to set up some workflow for Developer Certificate of Origin before we will be able to merge any
external changes.

It is also worthy of note that this repository itself is only a temporary step on the road, as all the
code will be moved into new STRATO Mercato org.
