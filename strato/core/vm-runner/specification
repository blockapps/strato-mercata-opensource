As we discussed:

 - The wrapper accumulates transactions into a new block.
 - It executes upon notification of a postgres trigger that a new best block was added.
 - It queries for the best block and forms a new block with it as the parent.
 - The new block will contain only transactions received by us within a certain time period and that are not yet in any block in the current chain (ancestors of the best block)
 - Parameter: t_range.  The radius around the parent's timestamp in which to consider new tranactions
 - To find new transactions, do two queries:
   - All transactions within t_range time of the parent's timestamp.
   - All blocks whose timestamp is in the same range.
 - Walk up the chain from the best block in the second set and remove their transactions from the first step.
 - The remaining transactions are wrapped into a new block.
 
DB considerations:

 - We must add a timestamp field to RawTransactions
 - Eventually, we need to normalize the relation between transactions and blocks, which is now many-to-many.
