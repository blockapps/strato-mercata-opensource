The blockchain is the underlying technology behind Bitcoin....  But, blockchain technology goes way beyond just being an "online currency".  The 
blockchain is a distributed system which can be used to verify and guarantee stated claims (account balance, resource ownership, legal contracts, 
etc).  The Ethereum blockchain allows Turing Complete code snippets to run on a blockchain, giving the user the fullest leeway to experiment 
with all imagined functionality.  (see http://ethereum.org for more info).

This package provides a tool written in Haskell to allow you to connect to the Ethereum blockchain (see http://gavwood.com/paper.pdf for detail 
of how this works).
