[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/json-rpc-client.svg?style=flat)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/json-rpc-client) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/grayjay/json-rpc-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/grayjay/json-rpc-client)


Functions for creating a JSON-RPC 2.0 client.  See
http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification. This library supports
batch requests and notifications, as well as single method
calls.  It also provides a function for creating corresponding
server-side methods with the package
[json-rpc-server](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/json-rpc-server).
This library does not handle transport, so a function for
communicating with the server must be provided.
